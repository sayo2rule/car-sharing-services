# car_sharing_services
Database management and data analytics from a car-sharing dataset. The dataset contains information about the customers' demand rate between January 2017 and August 2018.
The data were collected on an hourly basis and included the time data such as date, hour, and season as well as weather data such as the weather condition, temperature, humidity, and wind speed. The ‘demand’ column represents the customer’s willingness for renting a car for a specific time. Higher demand rates show that customers are more willing to rent a car and vice versa.
The project includes two sets of tasks corresponding to database management and data analytics.
